# Helmet-Detection
### Task :- Train object detection model to identify and count helmets from video.

<br>
## Steps Involved :-
#### 1. Data gathering
#### 2. Data Labelling
#### 3. Model/Algorithm Selection
#### 4. Fine-Tunning the model for helmet detection
#### 5. Testing on the given videos
#### 6. Saving the results


<br>
## Data gathering

#### The images for training the deeplearning model are gathered from repositories github.com (0816-Radhu/helmet_detection_using_machine_learning) and some random images of traffic containing bikers from websites like wired.com, bbc.com and youtube.com

<br>
## Data Labelling

#### To label the images an open-source tool labelImg is used (https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) in the format of yolo.
