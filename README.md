# Helmet-Detection
### Task :- Train object detection model to identify and count helmets from video.


## Steps Involved :-
#### 1. Data gathering
#### 2. Data Labelling
#### 3. Model/Algorithm Selection
#### 4. Fine-Tunning the model for helmet detection
#### 5. Testing on the given videos
#### 6. Saving the results


## Data gathering

#### The images for training the deeplearning model are gathered from github repository (0816-Radhu/helmet_detection_using_machine_learning) and some random images of traffic containing bikers from websites like wired.com, bbc.com and youtube.com


## Data Labelling

#### To label the images an open-source tool labelImg is used (https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) in the format of yolo.

## Model/Algorithm Selection

#### Model used for the task is ultralytics implementation of yolo-v5 model in PyTorch (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) 
#### YOLOv5 ðŸš€ is a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, and represents Ultralytics open-source research into future vision AI methods, incorporating lessons learned and best practices evolved over thousands of hours of research and development.


## Fine-Tunning the model for helmet detection

#### Model is trained/fine-tuned using the free-gpu provided by google colaboratory on the custom helmet detection dataset for 350 epochs. The library used is PyTorch.
